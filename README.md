# SnU-PharmaChain
Singh &amp; Umesh Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Using Ethereum smart contract.

The pharmaceutical industry around the world is in dire need to bolster its ability to track and trace the drugs that
are manufactured and shipped to pharmacies and hospitals. The regulations also include tracking medications that
are returned by stores and healthcare facilities for resale. In this project, we aim to implement a decentralised,
transparent, immutable record keeping system that ensures non-repudiation for a pharmaceutical supply chain.
With the help of a user-friendly front-end, customers can look at the details of the supply chain in real time to make
sure they’re not cheated. Similarly, we can trace the weak link in the supply chain to ﬁnd where drugs go missing. This
way, we ensure reduced losses and transparency between the customers, pharmaceutical companies and the
governing authorities.
